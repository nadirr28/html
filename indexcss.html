    <p id="para1">This is the internal css The sky turned a deep shade of orange as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet street. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the old banyan tree, and the faint hum of crickets signaled the arrival of evening. In the distance, a dog barked once, then fell silent, as if even it was caught up in the peaceful stillness. Life in the small town moved slowly, but within that calm was a rhythm that brought comfort — a quiet assurance that tomorrow would unfold just as gently as today.</p>

 <p class="para2">Beneath the surface of the ocean, an entirely different world exists—silent, mysterious, and full of life. Schools of vibrant fish dart between coral formations, weaving through the reefs like dancers in a choreographed performance. Sunlight filters through the water in shimmering beams, illuminating creatures that seem almost alien in form and color. A sea turtle glides gracefully past, unbothered by the curious gaze of divers. Down here, time feels slower, and every movement seems to carry a sense of ancient calm.
